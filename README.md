# ThingsTodoinSanFrancisco

Hi everyone,


I’m a San Franciscan Native, born and raised, and my goal is to help you navigate San Francisco in a way that you can find fun things to do here whether you’re visiting for the day or you have recently moved here.


Feel free to reach out with questions about places to stay, places to visit, places to eat, or anything else you want to know about San Francisco.

Feel free to fork the repository and create your own branch from here, edit the CSS, HTML, add in some cool Javascript Features and maybe some cool API's to help people navigate.  

I will add some API's to this branch in the near future, so let me know what you think, or if you wanna even work together on this.  

Always looking for new coders and fresh ideas for the project.
